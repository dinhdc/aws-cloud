# How can users access AWS ?

## Overview

- To access AWS, you have three options:
  - **AWS Management Console** (protected by password + MFA)
  - **AWS Command Line Interface** (CLI): protected by access keys
  - **AWS Software Developer Kit** (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys
- Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
- Users manage their own access keys
- **Access Keys are secret, just like a password. Don’t share them**
- Access Key ID ~= username
- Secret Access Key ~= password
