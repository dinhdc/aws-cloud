# Intro about Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the ```on-demand delivery``` of compute power, database storage,
applications, and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with ```pay-as-you-go pricing```
- You can ```provision exactly the right type and size of computing``` resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, ```almost instantly```
- Simple way to access ```servers, storage, databases``` and a set of ```application services```
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware
required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need
via a web application.

## The Deployment Models of the Cloud

### Private Cloud

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
- Complete control
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs
- Example: ```rackspace```

### Public Cloud

- Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
- Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- Example: ```Microsoft Azure```, ```Google Cloud```, ```Amazon Web Services```

### Hybrid Cloud

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### On-demand self service

- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider

### Broad network access

- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

### Multi-tenancy and resource pooling

- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

### Rapid elasticity and scalability

- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand

### Measured service

- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

### Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)

- Pay On-Demand: donâ€™t own hardware
- Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)

### Benefit from massive economies of scale

- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale

### Stop guessing capacity

- Scale based on actual measured usage

### Increase speed and agility

### Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

### Go global in minutes

- leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## Problems solved by the Cloud

### Flexibility

- change resource types when needed

### Cost-Effectiveness

- pay as you go, for what you use

### Scalability

- accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or
adding additional nodes

### Elasticity

- ability to scale out and scale-in when needed

### High-availability and fault-tolerance

- build across data centers

### Agility

- rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- Provide building blocks for cloud IT
- Provides networking, computers, data storage space
- Highest level of flexibility
- Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- Example:
  - Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
  - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
- Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- Example:
  - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
  - Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
- Example:
  - Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)
  - Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

## Pricing of the Cloud

- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing
model
- Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

### Compute

- Pay for compute time

### Storage

- Pay for data stored in the Cloud

### Data transfer OUT of the Cloud

- Data transfer IN is free
